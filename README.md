# Statistical Analysis of Real-Time PCR Data using R


Quantitative real-time PCR is an important technique in medical and bio-medical applications. The `pcr` package provides a unified interface for quality assessing, analyzing and testing qPCR data for statistical significance. The aim of this document is to describe the different methods and modes used to relatively quantify gene expression of qPCR and their implementation in the pcr package.
